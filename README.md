# The Game Of Life

The Game Of Life is a zero player game where cells in a universe
evolve and change over time. This program uses data types to handle
universe generation and function, and ncurses to visualize the universe

## File Information

Universe contains functions for the universe structure,
and life contains the main inputs, taking in arguments
and using them to run life with the inputs and files
- Inputted files should be in text files containing either 
coordinates for universe generation, or an output for printing

## How to run the program
- To run begin by inputting ./life, along with valid args
- valid args are t(toroidal), s(silence), n(num gen), i(input), and o(output)
- t and s are t/f toggles, n is an int, and i and o are file inputs
